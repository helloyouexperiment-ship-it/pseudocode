I may or may not agree with all of these parameters but I need to publish them so at least v0.1 exists. High potential to get distracted, if so will update in the future.
They were defined by Xi, a derivative of us, and ideally helpful to you. My human addition is #17, I have no plans to add tracking metrics for HYE.

Hello You Experiment — Success Parameters

Core definition

Success Score = S × T × A × V
	•	S (Survival/Acceptance): message is received and the receiver affirms they interpreted it as intended.
	•	T (Trust): no commercial incentive, clear provenance, privacy-safe.
	•	A (Acute spread): rapid early fan-out (time-bounded burst).
	•	V (Variation in space): many locally adapted versions that preserve the core.

⸻

1) Invariant kernel (IK)
	•	What: a 5–9 word core line everyone keeps verbatim.
	•	Target: 6±2 words, reading level ≤ Grade 6.
	•	Rule: all variants may change style/tone/medium, but IK is locked.

2) Semantic tolerance (ε)
	•	What: allowable drift from the intended meaning.
	•	Target: ε ≥ 0.80 cosine similarity to the IK explainer.
	•	Check: quick “interpretation accepted?” tap (Yes/No + 5-word paraphrase).

3) Compression + redundancy
	•	What: short, skimmable, error-tolerant.
	•	Targets: ≤ 140 chars primary line, plus one redundant cue (icon/gesture/example).
	•	Why: lowers loss over noisy channels.

4) Multimodal accessibility
	•	What: text + audio alt + simple visual.
	•	Targets: WCAG AA, captioned audio, dark/light variants, color-blind safe.

5) Provenance & integrity
	•	What: verify who sent it without hierarchy or prestige.
	•	Targets: human name (or community), timestamp, public checksum/shortcode.
	•	Rules: no trackers, no pixels, no dark patterns.

6) No-commerce covenant
	•	License: CC BY-NC-SA.
	•	Funding wall: if donations exist, route via independent fiscal sponsor; never co-located with message.
	•	Bans: ads, affiliate links, lead capture, upsells.

7) Remix envelope (RE)
	•	Degrees of freedom: language, tone, medium, typography, imagery, local examples.
	•	Constraints: IK locked; do-no-harm guidance; inclusive language list.
	•	Kit: provide open source files + simple remix form.

8) Local context hooks
	•	What: two blank slots per variant for place/people (e.g., “for Jackson and Ward 3”).
	•	Target: increases felt relevance; boosts acceptance.

9) Distribution topology
	•	Seed: 5–8 low-overlap clusters (work, school, hobby, faith, neighborhood).
	•	Fan-out ask: 3× within 24h (k=3), prefer private/peer channels first.
	•	Cadence: 72-hour burst, 4–7 day rest, then new wave.

10) Trust-first UX
	•	What: zero PII by default, open metrics page, plain-English “what this is / isn’t.”
	•	Signals: show “no commercial intent,” data policy in 3 lines.

11) Interpersonal relay protocol
	•	Micro-ritual: “Receive → paraphrase in 5 words → keep IK → remix 1 thing → relay to 3.”
	•	Reason: forces comprehension before forwarding.

12) Measurement (minimum viable telemetry)
	•	Acceptance rate (S): % “interpretation accepted.” (goal ≥ 85%)
	•	Trust score (T): % “would forward to someone I care about.” (goal ≥ 90%)
	•	Acute spread (A): Rₜ within 48h (goal > 2.0), median relay time (goal < 6h).
	•	Variation (V): remix entropy (unique variants / city), IK retention (goal 100%).
	•	Safety: harm/concern reports per 1k deliveries (goal < 1).

13) Guardrails & moderation
	•	Rapid correction: publish fixes within 12h for misinterpretations.
	•	Misuse net: lightweight report button; transparent incident log.
	•	Stop conditions: Trust < 0.85, or harm > 2/1k, or IK retention < 0.98.

14) Ethical consent
	•	Rule: explicit opt-in to receive/relay; do-not-forward affordance on every card.
	•	Context: avoid sensitive populations without community stewards.

15) Offline & resilient paths
	•	What: printable postcard + SMS-only text + hand script.
	•	Why: survives outages, crosses digital divides.

16) Stewardship model
	•	Who: rotating, anonymous stewards (no heroes).
	•	What: publish weekly notes: what changed, why, with links to artifacts.

⸻

Default knobs (start here)
	•	IK length: 6 words
	•	ε (semantic similarity): 0.80
	•	Fan-out k: 3 in 24h
	•	Burst window: 72h
	•	Reading level: ≤ Grade 6
	•	Trust goal: ≥ 90%
	•	Acceptance goal: ≥ 85%
	•	Target Rₜ (48h): > 2.0
	•	Variants per city (wave 1): ≥ 5 distinct remixes

⸻

Minimal run protocol (v1)
	1.	Publish IK + 1-page explainer + remix kit.
	2.	Seed 5–8 clusters with small introductions from known peers (no influencers).
	3.	Run 72-hour burst with the Receive → Paraphrase → Remix → Relay to 3 ritual.
	4.	Monitor S/T/A/V; ship one mid-burst correction if needed.
	5.	Pause 4–7 days; publish learnings + new hooks; repeat.

17) Offline Success Criterion — “Essence Test”

Definition (single gate):
Success is achieved the first time you personally hear the message (IK + intended meaning within ε) referenced offline, unprompted, by someone who does not know you’re involved.

What counts (“qualifying event”):
	•	Offline only: in-person conversation or a phone/voicemail heard in real time (no texts, DMs, posts, or screenshots).
	•	Unprompted: you did not steer the topic toward the message or ask about it directly.
	•	Independent: the speaker was not directly seeded by you and has no knowledge of your authorship/stewardship.
	•	Semantic match: the reference recites the IK verbatim or paraphrases it within the defined ε ≥ 0.80 tolerance.

What doesn’t count:
	•	Mentions triggered by you (“Have you heard about…?”), digital mentions, or any reference from a person you seeded or who knows your role.

Time window (for confidence, not requirement):
If a qualifying event occurs within 21 days of a wave’s public release, mark Wave Success. If later, still counts as Program Success, but note the latency.

Evidence capture (analog only):
Immediately after, jot on a card/notebook:
	•	Date, place, initials (optional)
	•	5–12 word paraphrase the person used
	•	How it arose (context)

No recordings, no photos, no names; respect privacy.

Falsification guard:
If there’s any doubt about prompting or independence, discard the event and wait for another.

Reset rule (if not achieved):
After 3 waves without a qualifying event, adjust one—and only one—of: seed clusters, local hooks, or remix envelope. Keep IK locked.
