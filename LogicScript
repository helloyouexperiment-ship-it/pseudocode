You're describing the concept of **pseudocode**. It's not a real, executable programming language but a "universal language" for programmers to outline a program's logic before writing it in a specific syntax like Python or Java.

Since syntax isn't important, the focus is on a few key building blocks that all programming languages share. Let's call your language **LogicScript**.


### The Core Concepts of LogicScript

LogicScript (and all coding) is built on just a few simple ideas:

1. **Variables:** These are boxes where you store information. You give each box a name.
    - `SET my_name = "Ryan"`
    - `SET user_age = 30`
2. **Conditionals (If/Then/Else):** This is how you make decisions. It's the most important concept.
    - `IF user_age > 18 THEN`
    - `PRINT "You are an adult."`
    - `ELSE`
    - `PRINT "You are a minor."`
    - `END IF`
3. **Loops (Iteration):** This is how you do something multiple times. The most common type is looping through a list of items.
    - `SET shopping_list = ["Apples", "Milk", "Bread"]`
    - `FOR EACH item IN shopping_list:`
    - `PRINT "Don't forget to buy: " + item`
    - `END LOOP`
4. **Functions (Procedures):** These are reusable blocks of code. You package logic inside a function and give it a name. This keeps your code clean and organized.
    - `FUNCTION calculate_tax(price):`
    - `SET tax_amount = price * 0.07`
    - `RETURN tax_amount`
    - `END FUNCTION`

### 🛒 LogicScript Example: The Smart Shopping Cart

Here is a complete program written in LogicScript. The goal is to calculate the total price of a shopping cart, applying a discount only to expensive items.

This example uses all the concepts above.

`// Define a function for calculating a special discount.
// We'll use this multiple times.
FUNCTION calculate_discount(item_price):
    // Use a conditional to make a decision
    IF item_price > 50 THEN
        // This item is expensive, give a 10% discount
        SET discount = item_price * 0.10
        PRINT "Applying a $10% discount!"
        RETURN discount
    ELSE
        // Not expensive, no discount
        RETURN 0
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// ----------------------------------------------------
// MAIN PROGRAM STARTS HERE
// ----------------------------------------------------

// 1. Set up our variables (the data)
SET shopping_cart = [
    {name: "T-Shirt", price: 25},
    {name: "Jeans", price: 45},
    {name: "Leather Jacket", price: 150}
]

SET grand_total = 0

PRINT "Welcome to the store. Checking your cart..."

// 2. Use a loop to check every item
FOR EACH item IN shopping_cart:
    PRINT "---"
    PRINT "Checking item: " + item.name
    PRINT "Base price: $" + item.price

    // 3. Use our function to see if a discount applies
    SET item_discount = calculate_discount(item.price)
    
    // 4. Calculate the final price for this item
    SET final_item_price = item.price - item_discount
    PRINT "Final item price: $" + final_item_price

    // 5. Add this item's final price to the grand total
    SET grand_total = grand_total + final_item_price
END LOOP

// 6. Print the final results
PRINT "========================="
PRINT "All items processed."
PRINT "Your final grand total is: $" + grand_total`

As you can see, anyone can read this and understand the **logic** without needing to know any specific programming syntax.
